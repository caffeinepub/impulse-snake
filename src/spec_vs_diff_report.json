  "summary": "REQ-17 appears implemented by updating the global keydown handler to early-return when a text-editing element is focused (via a new/used isTextEditingElement utility) and by stopping key event propagation on the Player Name input so typing (including X/C/V/B/N/M) does not trigger game controls while the input is focused. No backend or ui/ components changes are indicated.",

      "description": "Added a guard/flag to prevent multiple rapid game starts (isStarting with timeout) in the Space-bar handler.",
      "reason": "REQ-17 only asks to prevent global game keyboard handling from interfering while the Player Name input is focused; it does not request changes to game start/restart behavior beyond that.",
