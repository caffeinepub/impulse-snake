  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-20 by significantly increasing the Snake game playfield canvas size through responsive CSS utilities and dynamic canvas sizing. The canvas now scales from 700px-1300px across breakpoints (mobile to extra-large screens), uses ResizeObserver for responsive container measurement, maintains square aspect ratio, and preserves layout integrity with HUD and controls.",
